[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] Mary had a little lamb,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    Its fleece was white as snow,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] And every where that Mary went
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    The lamb was sure to go ;
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] He followed her to school one day—
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    That was against the rule,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] It made the children laugh and play,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    To see a lamb at school.
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] And so the Teacher turned him out,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    But still he lingered near,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] And waited patiently about,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    Till Mary did appear ;
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] And then he ran to her, and laid
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    His head upon her arm,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] As if he said—‘ I’m not afraid—
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    You’ll keep me from all harm.’
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] ‘ What makes the lamb love Mary so ?’
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    The eager children cry—
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] ‘ O, Mary loves the lamb, you know,’
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    The Teacher did reply ;—
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] ‘ And you each gentle animal
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    In confidence may bind,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen] And make them follow at your call,
[2021-04-07T05:33:41Z DEBUG log_gen]    If you are always kind.’
